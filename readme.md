# Bug-Report

Welcome to the Bug-Report!

You have been tasked with creating a tool to better report bugs for your team. The goal being, to better track bugs in your application, as well as the process taken to solve them.

All bugs will have a title, description, who reported the bug, closedDate and whether or not it has been closed.

Users can also add notes to the bug report providing detailed steps towards the bugs resolution.

Once a bug has been closed, no further editing is allowed.

Here are some mock-ups from the client.
